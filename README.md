_**"Information is the resolution of uncertainty"** - (Claude Shannon)_

I find data analysis so interesting because it helps making sense of a complex world.

- Long-term experience in data analysis, acquired mostly in [brain imaging](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yo8tYMMAAAAJ&hl=en), with some intermissions in ETL and [Photobiology](https://github.com/leonardocerliani/spectramap). 

- Strong preference for [R](https://www.r-project.org/), thanks to its clean syntax, emphasis on reproducibility, report-generation capabilities, and [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/) for web app and dashboard development

- Recently completed [several projects in business data analytics](http://www.google.com) at [Turing College](https://www.turingcollege.com/) and gained experience in fundamental tools such as SQL (Bigquery), Google Sheets and Tableau

Feel free to scroll through my repos, and to check [my (recently started) website](https://leonardoc.netlify.app/)

All the best! ðŸ¤— Leonardo
