_"Information is the resolution of uncertainty" - (Claude Shannon)_

I find data analysis so interesting because it helps making sense of a complex world - especially the human part of it.

- Long-term experience in data analysis, acquired mostly in [brain imaging][link_publications], with some intermissions in ETL and [Photobiology](https://github.com/leonardocerliani/spectramap). 


- Recently completed [several projects](google.com) in business data analytics at [Turing College](https://www.turingcollege.com/)
