_"Information is the resolution of uncertainty" - (Claude Shannon)_

I have a long-term experience in **data analysis**, acquired mostly in **brain imaging**, with some intermissions in **ETL** and **Photobiology**. 

At the end of the day, using statistics to discover patterns. Better if unexpected.
